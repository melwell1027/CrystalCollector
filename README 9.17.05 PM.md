# unit-4-game

## About This App

* This is a basic game built using jQuery.

* Each time the game loads there is a random number between 19 and 120 that is generated and displayed on the page.

* Each time the game loads and reloads after win/loss, there is a different random number between 1 and 12 assigned to each crystal button.

* When each crystal is clicked, its value is added to the total score which is displayed on the page.

* The player wins if they match their number to the random generated number.

* They player loses if their number goes above the randomy generated number.

* After the player wins or loses, the game resets by assigning new values to the random number and to each crystal button.

* The game logs wins and losses each game.
